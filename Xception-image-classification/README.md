# Xception-image-classification

Indian Bird Species Classification using CNN
This project is focused on developing a deep learning model to classify images of Indian bird species into 25 distinct classes. The dataset comprises 30,000 training images and 7,500 validation images, representing different bird species commonly found in India.
## Dataset

The dataset contains a total of 37,000 images split into train and validation sets in an 80:20 ratio, with 30,000 images in the training set and 7,500 images in the validation set. Each species has 1,500 images in the dataset. This dataset can be used for image classification tasks and to develop machine learning models to recognize different species of birds found in India.

## Project Structure
* Dataset: The dataset is organized into training and validation sets, each containing images categorized into 25 classes.
* Model: An Xception model was implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. Xception is an extension of the Inception architecture, utilizing depthwise separable convolutions to improve model performance while reducing computational cost.

* Data Augmentation: Data augmentation techniques such as random flipping, rotation, and zooming were applied to enhance model generalization.
* Optimization: The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer and trained with early stopping and checkpointing to save the best-performing model.
* Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated based on accuracy and loss on the validation set.
## Key Features
* Xception Architecture: Utilized Xception for its advanced performance in image classification tasks, leveraging depthwise separable convolutions.
* Data Augmentation: Integrated data augmentation to improve model robustness.
* Training Optimization: Early stopping and model checkpointing to ensure optimal training and prevent overfitting.
* TensorBoard: Visualization of training progress using TensorBoard.
