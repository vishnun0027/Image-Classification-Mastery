# Image Classification using various deep learning architectures

## Overview

This project explores image classification using various deep learning architectures. We implemented and compared the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), VGG, ResNet, DenseNet, GoogleNet, and more on a comprehensive dataset. Each model's architecture was leveraged to understand its strengths in feature extraction and classification accuracy. The repository includes code for training, testing, and evaluating these models, along with pre-trained weights and detailed instructions for replication.
## Dataset

The dataset contains a total of 37,000 images split into train and validation sets in an 80:20 ratio, with 30,000 images in the training set and 7,500 images in the validation set. Each species has 1,500 images in the dataset. This dataset can be used for image classification tasks and to develop machine learning models to recognize different species of birds found in India.
